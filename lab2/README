Everything works! The towerMain.c was fixed and is free from any bugs and the program compiles/executes succesfully.


Requirement 1

Question:

Suppose that towers (5,2,3) is invoked.

1) The first recursive call to towers() will be in the form: towers(4,2,1).

2) 5 recursive calls will be made to towers() before the first recursive call actually returns to the initial invocation.

3) The move made by towers(5,2,3) would be "Move #1: From Tower 2 to Tower 3".

4) The second recursive call to towers() will be in the form: towers(3,2,3).

Question:

Suppose that towers (8,1,2) is invoked. How many lines will be printed to stdout?

1) If towers (8,1,2) is invoked, 255 lines will be printed to stdout. This was gained through the use of: # of moves= 2^(n)-1, where n is the number of disks you wish to move. In our case 2^(8)-1 = 255, Therefore 255 lines to be printed out to stdout. Additionally ran towers 8 1 2 in the termianl and we know the # of moves is equal to the # of lines and for this specific case we got 255 moves therefore 255 lines.
